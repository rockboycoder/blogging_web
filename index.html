              <h2>A temple of love</h2>
              <p>Prem Mandir is one of the youngest temples standing in the holy city of Vrindavan. It was opened for public in 2012 and ever since has been a centre of attraction for the pilgrims. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to love and contains idols of Lord Krishna with Radha and Sri Ram with Sita. The interiors of the temple suggest a heavy use of Italian marble. There are beautiful motifs and designs strewn all over the temple.

                Timings: 5:30 AM – 12 PM, 4:30 PM – 8:30 PM
                Must see: A musical fountain show is organized at the temple premises every evening from 7 – 7:30 PM.

              <h2>Tourist attractions of Vrindavan </h2>
              <p>Built in 1580, by a merchant named Ram Das Kapoor, Madan Mohan temple is the oldest temple of Vrindavan. It is believed that Lord Krishna rested at this exact site after killing the demon snake – Kaliya. History of this holy temple actually dates back to over 5000 years, when the first temple was constructed by the great grandson of Krishna, Vajranabh. But as time passed the temple disappeared, before Ram Das Kapoor decided to build the modern day temple. Madan Mohan temple stands at a height of 60 feet and is blessed with great beauty. A special dish known as Anga Kadi (which is believed to be Lord Krishna’s favourite food) is offered to the deity every day at the temple.

                Timings: 6 AM – 11 AM, 5 PM – 9.30 PM
                Trivia: The Lord Krishna idol at Madan Mohan Mandir is only a replica of the original idol. During the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, when many Hindu temples of the area were being destroyed, the priests decided to send the original idol to Karauli (near Jaipur) for safekeeping. The original idol was never brought back!.</p>

              <h2>Most famous temple of vrindavan</h2>
              <p>Banke Bihari temple is one of the most revered temples of Vrindavan. Banke Bihari, the presiding deity, means bent in three places. The idol of Lord Krishna at this temple can be seen standing in a unique posture, justifying the naming of this temple. As the lore goes, the idol was first worshipped by Swami Haridas, who was the Guru of iconic singer Tansen. He installed this idol at Nidhivan. It was later brought to the Banke Bihari temple. It is believed that the idol was handed over to Swami Haridas by Lord Krishna himself!

                Timings: 9 AM – 1 PM, 4:30 PM – 8:30 PM
                Tip: The temple premises are filled with monkeys. So, do not carry any food items in the open to keep yourself protected from them..</p>

              <h2>a story of breaking the proud of king of heaven Indra</h2>
              <p>As per the Gita, Govardhan Hill is an embodiment of Lord Krishna himself. It is believed that Lord Krishna shielded his devotees from a devastating flood by upholding this hill. As the myths go, Lord Krishna and his elder brother (Balarama), during their childhood days, would roam around the Govardhan Hill. When Lord Krishna grew up he played Raas Leela with Radha on these hills. There are five temples situated on the hill which receive a high footfall of devotees all through the year..</p>
